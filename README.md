# **Kaggle ML Journey – From Scratch to Skilled 🚀**

Welcome to my **daily Machine Learning journey**, where I build, train, and upload one Kaggle project every single day.
This repository documents my complete learning path — starting from beginner-friendly datasets like **Titanic**, **House Prices**, and gradually moving toward advanced ML & DL challenges.
